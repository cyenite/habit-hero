4. Configure Google Sign-In:
   - Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable Google Sign-In API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Add your client ID to `web/index.html` in the meta tag:
     ```html

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **Riverpod**: State management
- **Google Fonts**: Custom typography
- **Lottie**: Fluid animations
- **FL Chart**: Data visualization

### Backend
- **Supabase**: Backend as a Service
  - Authentication
  - Database
  - Real-time sync
  
### Local Storage
- **Hive**: NoSQL database for offline data
- **Shared Preferences**: Simple key-value storage

### Authentication
- **Supabase Auth**: Email/password authentication
- **Google Sign-In**: OAuth integration


## üîÑ Data Synchronization

The app implements a robust offline-first approach:
1. All changes are stored locally in Hive
2. When online, data is synchronized with Supabase
3. Conflict resolution strategies ensure data integrity


## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment with the following workflow:

### CI Workflow (on every push and PR)
1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Configures Java and Flutter
3. **Dependencies**: Installs all project dependencies
4. **Code Analysis**: Runs Flutter analyzer to ensure code quality
5. **Unit Testing**: Executes all unit tests to verify functionality
6. **Environment Configuration**: Sets up environment variables for builds
7. **Build APK**: Creates a release Android APK
8. **Build Web**: Creates a release web build
9. **Artifact Publishing**: Uploads build artifacts for download
10. **Release Creation**: Creates a GitHub release when pushing to main branch

### CD Workflow (Firebase Deployment)
A separate workflow deploys the web build to Firebase Hosting:

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Configures Java and Flutter
3. **Build Web**: Creates a release web build
4. **Firebase Deployment**: Deploys the web build to Firebase Hosting

These automated workflows ensure that:
- All code meets quality standards
- Tests pass on every change
- Builds are automatically generated
- Releases are properly versioned
- Web deployments happen automatically

To view workflow runs and artifacts, visit the Actions tab in the GitHub repository.
